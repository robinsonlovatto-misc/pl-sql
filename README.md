1. **[Control Framework for Automated Tasks](https://github.com/robinsonlovatto/pl-sql/tree/main/control_framework_for_automated_tasks)**

This is a framework to control automated tasks (or any task actually) developed by the authors of the book [Real-World SQL and PL/SQL: Advice from the Experts](https://www.mhprofessional.com/real-world-sql-and-pl-sql-advice-from-the-experts-9781259640971-usa-group). As a contribution, I only made a small fix in the pna_maint.get_prma procedure.
